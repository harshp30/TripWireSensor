My tripwire project consists on two key components.
The first component is the ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) whih constantly calculates the distance between itself and the nearest object such as a wall or door.
The second component is the buzzer attached to the breadboard which is the main indicator that the user has to any movemnt within a certain range of the ultrasonic distance sensor.
In this case when the distance between the ultrasoinic distance sensor and the nearest object (door) was less than 10cm the buzzer sounded.
The entire system would indicate, through the buzzer, anytime the door was open or closed.
The entire system is powered by a battery which is directly connected to a switch and the rest o fthe system.
The switch is a physica on-off switch rather than a digital one.
This ensures that the battery is not deplieting while the system is off.

Lessons:

My first time working with sensors in a real-life application. This could be useful for security purposes but much more effective with a louder continous alarm.
